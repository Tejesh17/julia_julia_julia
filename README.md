# julia_julia_julia

When I first came across Julia (the programming language), it had to be done. Something to relate one of my favourite songs [Julia - Jeremy Zucker](https://youtu.be/6yhg44R7hxs) to this language.

I decided to write a program in Julia which displays the lyrics of any song called Julia by any artist by taking the artist as an input while making Jeremy's Julia a default option.

Unfortunately due to Julia's shitty HTTP documentation combined with the shitty music API. I had to resort to printing the lyrics of only Jeremy's song. I will for sure make this program what it deserves to be when Julia gets better. (devs pls fix)

## To Run 

Install Julia's HTTP and JSON library using the following code in command line mode:

```Julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("HTTP")
Pkg.add("JSON")
```

After this run the main file using `julia main.jl`.

Also at this point I'm just farming green squares on homepage which give me dopamine.
